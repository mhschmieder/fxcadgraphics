/**
 * The <code>SolidObject</code> class is the abstract base class for all solid
 * objects. It describes the attributes that are common to all solid objects in
 * a 3D view, such as orientation, and whether inverted in that orientation.
 * <p>
 * Many, but not all, of the derived classes are GC-centric. This means that the
 * GC is used for placement. This is not always the appropriate reference point
 * though; the "Location" field in the parent class is generally the common
 * denominator there, but currently only has two dimensional coordinates vs.
 * three. At some point, the parent class may add a z-axis coordinate.
 * <p>
 * At this point in the class hierarchy, most coordinates will be in vector form
 * unless used for containment and intersection tests via the JavaFX Graphics
 * library, in which case we use simple Poin2D and Point3D immutable instances.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: All data should be private, in case of overrides on getter methods.
 *  Also, this means member variables should not be accessed directly, in case
 *  of overrides on getter methods in subclasses.
